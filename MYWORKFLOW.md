# MY WORKFLOW: AI Orchestration Approach

## Overview
I operate as an orchestrator between AI systems, coordinating their efforts to develop complete products. I don't write code or detailed prompts - I leverage AI assistants for these tasks, acting as a strategic director of the development process.

## Core Principles
- Minimize direct technical involvement
- Maximize AI system collaboration
- Focus on coordination and oversight
- Let AI handle the complex details

## Workflow Phases

### 1. IDEATION
- Initial conversation with AI LLM about app overview
- Capture entire conversation via copy/paste
- Keep discussion high-level and conceptual
- Focus on desired outcomes, not technical details

### 2. PLANNING
- Present captured conversation to DEV TEAM (ChatHub instance)
- Have AI assistant:
  - Create summary of requirements
  - Extract key points from conversation
  - Convert into PRD format
  - Generate initial task list
- Attach all relevant conversations and context

### 3. ORGANIZATION
- Have AI assistant:
  - Design task distribution between teams
  - Create task request .md files
  - Create pre-labeled response .md files for teams
  - Structure the workflow sequence
- Review and approve task organization

### 4. EXECUTION
- Teams process assigned tasks
- Monitor progress
- Maintain task sequence
- Ensure each team has necessary context
- Keep information flowing between teams

### 5. INTEGRATION
- Have AI assistant:
  - Collect all team responses
  - Integrate components
  - Build complete product
  - Ensure coherent assembly
- Review integration progress

### 6. TESTING
- Verify functionality
- Check for completeness
- Validate against original requirements
- Identify any gaps or issues

### 7. DELIVERY
- Final review
- Confirm all requirements met
- Project completion
- Archive for future reference

## My Role
- I don't write code
- I don't write detailed prompts
- I coordinate between AI systems
- I review and approve
- I ensure quality and completeness
- I maintain project momentum

## Working With Me
- Present all technical details in .md format
- Handle task distribution automatically
- Manage file organization
- Create structured response templates
- Maintain clear communication
- Focus on results, not process

## Expected AI Assistant Responsibilities
- Create detailed prompts from my high-level input
- Generate task lists and distributions
- Create and manage .md files
- Handle technical details and implementation
- Integrate team outputs
- Provide clear progress updates

Remember: I am the orchestra conductor, not the musician. I direct and coordinate, while AI systems handle the execution details.
