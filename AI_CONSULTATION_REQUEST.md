# AI Consultation Request: Multi-Task File Attachment Issue

## Problem Description

We have a React application with a multi-task processing system where users can upload files and assign tasks to different AI teams. The issue is that while file attachments work perfectly in regular mode, they fail in multi-task mode.

### Current Behavior
- **Regular Mode**: ✅ Files upload correctly, models can read file content
- **Multi-Task Mode**: ❌ Files appear to upload but models respond with "I cannot directly access or read files uploaded by users"

### Technical Details

**File Attachment Flow:**
1. User selects file via `<input type="file">`
2. File is processed with `FileReader.readAsText()`
3. Content is stored in global Zustand store as `FileAttachment` objects
4. Attachments are copied to task queue when tasks are added
5. Tasks are processed via `openRouterService.sendPrompt()`

**Key Code Sections:**

**File Processing (App.tsx):**
```typescript
const handleAddAttachment = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  if (e.target.files && e.target.files.length > 0) {
    const selectedFiles = Array.from(e.target.files);
    selectedFiles.forEach(file => {
      const attachment = addAttachment(file.name);
      const reader = new FileReader();
      reader.onload = (event) => {
        const content = event.target?.result as string;
        updateAttachment(attachment.id, 'success', undefined, content);
      };
      reader.readAsText(file);
    });
  }
};
```

**Task Addition (App.tsx):**
```typescript
const handleAddTask = () => {
  // Check if all attachments have content loaded
  const attachmentsWithoutContent = attachments.filter(att => !att.content);
  if (attachmentsWithoutContent.length > 0) {
    setTimeout(() => handleAddTask(), 100);
    return;
  }
  
  setTaskQueue(prev => [...prev, {
    prompt: taskPrompt,
    attachments: [...attachments], // Copy global attachments
    team: taskTeam
  }]);
  clearAttachments(); // Clear global store
};
```

**API Service (OpenRouterService.ts):**
```typescript
const attachmentsToString = (attachments: FileAttachment[]) => {
  if (attachments.length === 0) return '';
  const result = `\nAttached files:\n${attachments.map(a => 
    `- ${a.name} (${a.status})${a.content ? `\nContent (first 1MB):\n${a.content.slice(0, 1024 * 1024)}` : ''}`
  ).join('\n\n')}`;
  return result;
};
```

### Console Logs Analysis

The console shows:
- ✅ File selection works: "Files selected: ['DATA COLLECTION.md']"
- ✅ State updates: "taskAttachments state changed: ['DATA COLLECTION.md']"
- ✅ API connections successful
- ❌ But models still can't access files

### Questions for AI Experts

1. **File Content Verification**: How can we verify that file content is actually being included in the API request payload?

2. **Asynchronous Timing**: Could there be a race condition where tasks are processed before file content is fully loaded?

3. **API Payload Structure**: Are we formatting the attachment data correctly for the OpenRouter API?

4. **State Management**: Is there an issue with how we're copying attachments from global store to task queue?

5. **Alternative Approaches**: Should we consider a different approach to handling file attachments in multi-task mode?

6. **Debugging Strategy**: What additional debugging steps would you recommend to isolate the exact failure point?

### Current Debugging Attempts

- Added comprehensive console logging
- Implemented content loading checks
- Verified file reading process
- Checked state management flow
- Confirmed API key and connection status

### Request for Guidance

We need expert advice on:
- How to properly debug the API payload being sent
- Potential architectural issues with the multi-task attachment system
- Best practices for handling file attachments in React/Zustand applications
- Alternative approaches that might be more reliable

Please provide specific, actionable guidance to resolve this issue.
