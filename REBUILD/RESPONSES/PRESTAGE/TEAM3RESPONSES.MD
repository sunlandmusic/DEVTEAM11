### Critical Path
Browser Management → Team Processor → Response Collector → UI Integration

## 2. Backend-UI Integration Strategy

### Integration Points
1. **Prompt Submission**
   - UI sends prompt and selected teams to backend
   - Backend confirms receipt and initiates processing

2. **Status Updates**
   - Backend pushes regular status updates for UI rendering
   - Team-specific status information for visual feedback

3. **Result Display**
   - Backend provides formatted results to UI
   - UI renders markdown content with appropriate styling

### State Synchronization
```typescript
// Implement a state observer pattern
class BackendStateManager {
  private subscribers: ((state: SystemState) => void)[] = [];
  private currentState: SystemState;
  
  updateState(newState: Partial<SystemState>) {
    this.currentState = {...this.currentState, ...newState};
    this.notifySubscribers();
  }
  
  subscribe(callback: (state: SystemState) => void) {
    this.subscribers.push(callback);
    return () => {
      this.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter(sub => sub !== callback);
    };
  }
  
  private notifySubscribers() {
    this.subscribers.forEach(callback => callback(this.currentState));
  }
}
```

### Event Handling
- Use event emitters for browser instance events
- Implement event delegation for UI components
- Create typed event interfaces for consistency

### Status Update Propagation
```typescript
// Real-time status updates
function broadcastTeamStatus(teamId: number, status: TeamStatus) {
  stateManager.updateState({
    processingStatus: {
      ...currentStatus,
      teamStatus: {
        ...currentStatus.teamStatus,
        [teamId]: status
      }
    }
  });
}
```

  processTeam(teamId: number, prompt: string): Promise<TeamResponse>;
}
```

**State Manager ↔ UI Integration**
```typescript
interface StateUpdate {
  type: 'team' | 'system' | 'browser' | 'error';
  payload: any;
}

// UI Integration uses these methods

### 2. Integration Specification

This specification details the contract between the Node.js backend and the existing React UI. Given the need for real-time updates, a WebSocket-based approach is strongly recommended over traditional HTTP requests. Node.js libraries like `ws` or `Socket.io` can be used.

**2.1. API & Event Contracts (WebSocket)**

The backend will run a WebSocket server that the React UI connects to.

**Client-to-Server Events:**

*   `process:start`
    *   **Payload**: `{ selectedTeams: number[], prompt: string }`
    *   **Description**: The UI sends this to initiate processing for the selected teams with the given prompt.
*   `app:quit`
    *   **Payload**: None
    *   **Description**: The UI sends this before the window closes to allow the backend to gracefully shut down browser instances.

**Server-to-Client Events:**

*   `system:state:update`
    *   **Payload**: `SystemState` (as defined in `BACKEND.md`)
    *   **Description**: The backend will broadcast this event **anytime the state changes**. The UI should listen for this single event and update its components based on the new state object. This simplifies state synchronization immensely.
    *   **Example Usage**:
        *   On startup, the backend sends the initial `Idle` state.
        *   When `process:start` is received, it immediately sends a `Processing` state update (disabling UI controls).
        *   As each team completes, it sends an update with the `completedTeams` array modified.
        *   When an error occurs, it sends an update with the `errors` object populated.

**2.2. State Synchronization**

*   **Single Source of Truth**: The Node.js backend's `StateManager` is the single source of truth. The React UI is a passive reflection of this state.
*   **Mechanism**: The `system:state:update` event is the sole mechanism for synchronization. The React app should take the received payload and set its root state, allowing props and context to propagate the changes through the component tree.

**2.3. Error Handling**

*   When the backend catches an error (e.g., in `handleTeamError`), it updates the `processingStatus.errors` object in the main state.
*   It then broadcasts the new state via `system:state:update`.
*   The UI sees the populated `errors` object and can display appropriate notifications for the failed team(s), while other teams continue processing.

---

### 3. Team Coordination Plan

This plan distributes the work across four teams to maximize parallel development.

*   **Team 1: Core Services Team**
    *   **Responsibilities**: `BrowserManager` implementation (Task IDs T1.x).
    *   **Deliverable**: A testable `BrowserManager` class that can launch, manage, and terminate browser instances. This is the foundational piece.
    *   **Interface Contract**: Exposes `initialize()`, `cleanup()`, and `getInstance(teamId)`.

*   **Team 2: Processing Logic Team**
    *   **Responsibilities**: `TeamProcessor` implementation (Task IDs T2.x).
    *   **Deliverable**: The core `processTeam` and `processTeams` functions.
    *   **Interface Contract**: Consumes `BrowserManager` to get a browser instance. It will take a `prompt` and `teamId` and return a result object. Team 3 can provide a mock `BrowserManager` for development.

*   **Team 3: Error Handling & Filesystem Team**
    *   **Responsibilities**: Filesystem operations and error recovery (Task IDs T3.x).
    *   **Deliverable**: Robust `exportTeamResults` and `handleTeamError` functions. They will also define the mocking strategy for the `BrowserManager` and Playwright `browser` objects.
    *   **Interface Contract**: Provides the `exportTeamResults` function to be called by Team 2. Provides the `handleTeamError` function to be used in the main processing loop.

*   **Team 4: State & Integration Team**
    *   **Responsibilities**: `StateManager` and UI integration via WebSockets (Task IDs T4.x).
    *   **Deliverable**: The `StateManager` class and the WebSocket server that exposes the API defined in the Integration Specification.
    *   **Interface Contract**: Provides the central state object and the `system:state:update` event for the UI. It will orchestrate calls to the functions developed by other teams.

**Coordination & Timeline:**

*   **Hour 0-1**: All teams kick-off. Team 1 focuses on `BrowserManager`. Team 3 begins building mocks. Team 4 defines the final `SystemState` interface and shares it. Team 2 plans the Chathub.gg interaction steps.
*   **Hour 2-4**: Team 1 delivers the `BrowserManager`. Teams 2 and 3 integrate with it and continue their primary tasks. Team 4 builds the WebSocket server.
*   **Hour 5-6**: All teams conduct unit tests and component-level integration. Team 4 integrates the processing and export functions into the main state flow.
*   **Hour 7-8**: Full system integration and end-to-end testing with the UI.

### 4. Technical Recommendations

**4.1. Architecture & Performance**

*   **Architecture Validation**: The proposed component-based architecture is sound and well-suited for this problem. It correctly separates concerns.
*   **Browser Launch Optimization**:
    1.  **Persistent Context**: Instead of launching a new browser for every run, launch them once on application startup. For each processing request, create a new *incognito browser context* (`browser.newContext()`). This is dramatically faster than a full browser launch and provides the same session isolation.
    2.  **Lazy Launch**: Launch browsers in the background upon application start, before any user request comes in.
*   **Memory Usage Reduction**:
    1.  **Aggressive Cleanup**: After each team's run, be sure to close the page (`page.close()`) and the browser context (`context.close()`).
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features**: Use Playwright launch options to disable extensions, GPU acceleration (if not needed), and other features to reduce the memory footprint of each instance: `args: ['--disable-extensions', '--disable-gpu']`.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Your choice of WebSockets for Backend-UI communication is excellent. It's efficient and well-suited for the real-time updates you need. This is a better choice than polling via HTTP.

**4.2. Reliability & Integration**

*   **Error Recovery**: The plan to restart a failed team's browser is good for catastrophic failures. For transient network errors during processing, implement a simple retry mechanism (e.g., 1-2 retries with a short delay) within the `executeTeamPrompt` function before escalating to a full browser restart.
*   **State Consistency**: The "Single Source of Truth" model where the backend owns the state and broadcasts it via `system:state:update` is the best way to ensure consistency and prevent race conditions between the backend and UI.
*   **Monitoring Metrics**:
    1.  **Processing Duration**: `end_time - start_time` for each team and for the overall request.
    2.  **Error Rate**: Count of errors per team / total runs.
    3.  **Resource Usage**: Monitor Node.js process memory and CPU usage.
    4.  **Browser Health**: Track browser launch successes/failures.

**4.3. Testing Strategy**

*   **Mocking**: Team 3 should lead this. Use a library like `jest` to mock the entire Playwright `browser` object. Your mock should allow you to simulate:
    *   Successful page interactions.
    *   Functions that return pre-defined content.
    *   Functions that throw specific errors (e.g., timeout, navigation failure).
    This will allow Team 2 to test their logic thoroughly without needing a real browser, which is key for speed.
*   **CI/CD**: For now, focus on local testing. A CI/CD pipeline would involve running Jest unit tests (with mocks) on every commit. Integration tests requiring real browsers can be run in a headless environment within a GitHub Action or similar service.
