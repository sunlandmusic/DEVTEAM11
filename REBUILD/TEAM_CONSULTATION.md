# DEVTEAM Implementation Consultation Request

## Overview
We are implementing the DEVTEAM AI orchestration system that manages 4 parallel teams processing requests via Chathub.gg. The backend architecture has been designed (see attached BACKEND.md), and we need your expertise for implementation planning and task distribution. The UI implementation is complete and ready for integration.

## Key Questions

### 1. Task List Development
Please provide:
- A detailed breakdown of all backend implementation tasks
- Estimated time for each task
- Dependencies between tasks
- Critical path identification
- Suggested task execution order
- Risk assessment for each major task component

### 2. Backend-UI Integration Strategy
We need specific recommendations for:
- Integration points with the existing UI components
- State synchronization between backend and UI
- Event handling for browser instances
- Status update propagation to UI
- Error handling and display coordination
- Processing state management

### 3. Task Distribution Strategy
Propose how to divide the backend implementation across our 4 teams:
- Which team should handle which backend components
- How to minimize cross-team dependencies
- Interface contracts between team deliverables
- Coordination points and integration timeline
- Parallel development opportunities
- Shared resource management

### 4. Technical Considerations

#### Architecture Validation
- Review the proposed backend architecture for potential bottlenecks
- Suggest optimizations for parallel processing
- Identify potential scaling issues
- Recommend performance monitoring points

#### Integration Testing
- Propose integration testing strategy
- Define key test scenarios
- Suggest mocking approach for development
- Outline CI/CD requirements

## Additional Questions

### Performance
1. How can we optimize the browser launch sequence for faster startup?
2. What strategies would you recommend for reducing memory usage across 4 browser instances?
3. How can we minimize inter-process communication overhead?

### Reliability
1. What additional error recovery mechanisms should we implement?
2. How can we ensure consistent state across all teams during parallel processing?
3. What monitoring metrics should we track for system health?

### Integration
1. What's the best way to handle browser instance lifecycle with the UI?
2. How should we coordinate state transitions between backend and UI?
3. What's the optimal way to propagate browser events to the UI?

## Deliverables Expected

1. **Task Breakdown Document**
   - Detailed backend task list with estimates
   - Team assignments
   - Dependencies map
   - Timeline projection

2. **Integration Specification**
   - API contracts
   - State management design
   - Event handling documentation
   - Error handling procedures

3. **Team Coordination Plan**
   - Communication protocols
   - Code sharing strategy
   - Integration checkpoints
   - Review process

4. **Technical Recommendations**
   - Architecture optimization suggestions
   - Performance improvement recommendations
   - Testing strategy details

## Timeline
- We aim to complete implementation today
- Please prioritize recommendations that support rapid development
- Focus on pragmatic solutions that maintain system reliability
- Suggest any shortcuts that won't compromise system integrity

## Additional Context
- The UI implementation is complete and ready for integration
- We're using Playwright for browser automation
- The system needs to handle 24 AI models (6 per team)
- Zero-storage architecture is a critical requirement

Please provide your responses with implementation-ready detail level. Code examples, specific configurations, and concrete patterns are highly valuable.
