# DEVTEAM Implementation Consultation Response

## 1. Task List Development

### Backend Implementation Tasks Breakdown

#### Core Infrastructure (Critical Path - Start First)
**Task 1.1: Browser Manager Implementation (4 hours)**
- Dependencies: None
- Risk: Medium - Browser automation setup can be finicky
- Code:
```typescript
class BrowserManager {
  private instances: Map<number, Browser> = new Map();
  private readonly config = {
    maxInstances: 4,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
    timeout: 300000
  };

  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    const launches = Array.from({ length: 4 }, async (_, i) => {
      const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
        headless: false,
        viewport: this.config.viewport,
        args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage']
      });
      this.instances.set(i + 1, browser);
      return this.positionBrowser(browser, i);
    });
    
    await Promise.all(launches);
  }

  private async positionBrowser(browser: Browser, index: number) {
    const positions = [
      { x: 0, y: 0 },      // Team 1: Top-left
      { x: 640, y: 0 },    // Team 2: Top-right
      { x: 0, y: 360 },    // Team 3: Bottom-left
      { x: 640, y: 360 }   // Team 4: Bottom-right
    ];
    
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.setViewportSize(this.config.viewport);
    // Platform-specific positioning logic here
  }
}
```

**Task 1.2: State Management System (3 hours)**
- Dependencies: None (parallel with 1.1)
- Risk: Low
- Code:
```typescript
interface SystemState {
  processingStatus: {
    isProcessing: boolean;
    activeTeams: Set<number>;
    completedTeams: Set<number>;
    failedTeams: Map<number, Error>;
  };
  browserStatus: Map<number, 'ready' | 'busy' | 'error'>;
  lastProcessingTime: number;
}

class StateManager {
  private state: SystemState = this.getInitialState();
  private listeners: Set<(state: SystemState) => void> = new Set();

  updateTeamStatus(teamId: number, status: 'ready' | 'busy' | 'error') {
    this.state.browserStatus.set(teamId, status);
    this.notifyListeners();
  }

  startProcessing(teamIds: number[]) {
    this.state.processingStatus.isProcessing = true;
    this.state.processingStatus.activeTeams = new Set(teamIds);
    this.state.processingStatus.completedTeams.clear();
    this.state.processingStatus.failedTeams.clear();
    this.notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

#### Team Processing Engine (Critical Path - Depends on 1.1)
**Task 2.1: Individual Team Processor (5 hours)**
- Dependencies: Browser Manager
- Risk: High - Core business logic
- Code:
```typescript
class TeamProcessor {
  constructor(
    private browserManager: BrowserManager,
    private stateManager: StateManager
  ) {}

  async processTeam(teamId: number, prompt: string): Promise<TeamResult> {
    const browser = this.browserManager.getInstance(teamId);
    this.stateManager.updateTeamStatus(teamId, 'busy');
    
    try {
      // Navigate to ChatHub
      const page = await browser.newPage();
      await page.goto('https://chathub.gg');
      
      // Setup team environment (6 models)
      await this.setupTeamModels(page);
      
      // Execute prompt
      const response = await this.executePrompt(page, prompt);
      
      // Extract and format response
      const formattedResponse = await this.formatResponse(response);
      
      this.stateManager.updateTeamStatus(teamId, 'ready');
      return { teamId, status: 'success', response: formattedResponse };
      
    } catch (error) {
      this.stateManager.updateTeamStatus(teamId, 'error');
      throw new TeamProcessingError(teamId, error);
    }
  }

  private async setupTeamModels(page: Page) {
    // Configure 6 AI models per team
    const models = ['gpt-4', 'claude-3', 'gemini-pro', 'perplexity', 'cohere', 'llama2'];
    for (const model of models) {
      await this.selectModel(page, model);
    }
  }
}
```

**Task 2.2: Parallel Processing Orchestrator (3 hours)**
- Dependencies: Team Processor
- Risk: Medium - Coordination complexity
- Code:
```typescript
class ProcessingOrchestrator {
  async processTeams(selectedTeams: number[], prompt: string): Promise<ProcessingResult> {
    const processor = new TeamProcessor(this.browserManager, this.stateManager);
    
    // Start processing all teams in parallel
    const teamPromises = selectedTeams.map(async (teamId) => {
      try {
        return await processor.processTeam(teamId, prompt);
      } catch (error) {
        return { teamId, status: 'error', error };
      }
    });

    const results = await Promise.allSettled(teamPromises);
    
    // Aggregate results
    return this.aggregateResults(results);
  }

  private aggregateResults(results: PromiseSettledResult<TeamResult>[]): ProcessingResult {
    const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length;
    const failed = results.filter(r => r.status === 'rejected').length;
    
    return {
      totalTeams: results.length,
      successful,
      failed,
      results: results.map(r => r.status === 'fulfilled' ? r.value : null)
    };
  }
}
```

#### File System Operations (Can be parallel)
**Task 3.1: Export System (2 hours)**
- Dependencies: None
- Risk: Low
- Code:
```typescript
class ExportManager {
  private readonly exportConfig = {
    baseDir: process.cwd(),
    filePrefix: 'TEAM',
    extension: '.md',
    encoding: 'utf-8' as const
  };

  async exportTeamResults(teamId: number, content: string): Promise<void> {
    const fileName = `${this.exportConfig.filePrefix}${teamId}${this.exportConfig.extension}`;
    const filePath = path.join(this.exportConfig.baseDir, fileName);
    
    const formattedContent = this.formatMarkdown(content, teamId);
    await fs.writeFile(filePath, formattedContent, this.exportConfig.encoding);
  }

  private formatMarkdown(content: string, teamId: number): string {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    return `# Team ${teamId} Results
Generated: ${timestamp}

${content}

---
*Generated by DEVTEAM AI Orchestration System*
`;
  }
}
```

#### Error Handling & Recovery (Can be parallel)
**Task 4.1: Error Management System (3 hours)**
- Dependencies: None
- Risk: Medium
- Code:
```typescript
class ErrorManager {
  private readonly maxRetries = 3;
  private readonly retryDelay = 2000;

  async handleTeamError(teamId: number, error: Error): Promise<boolean> {
    console.error(`Team ${teamId} error:`, error);
    
    if (this.isRecoverableError(error)) {
      return await this.attemptRecovery(teamId);
    }
    
    this.markTeamFailed(teamId, error);
    return false;
  }

  private async attemptRecovery(teamId: number): Promise<boolean> {
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= this.maxRetries; attempt++) {
      try {
        await this.delay(this.retryDelay * attempt);
        await this.restartTeamBrowser(teamId);
        return true;
      } catch (error) {
        if (attempt === this.maxRetries) {
          this.markTeamFailed(teamId, error);
          return false;
        }
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Task Execution Order & Critical Path

**Phase 1 (Parallel - 0-4 hours):**
- Task 1.1: Browser Manager (Team 1)
- Task 1.2: State Management (Team 2)
- Task 3.1: Export System (Team 3)
- Task 4.1: Error Management (Team 4)

**Phase 2 (Sequential - 4-9 hours):**
- Task 2.1: Team Processor (depends on 1.1)
- Task 2.2: Processing Orchestrator (depends on 2.1)

**Phase 3 (Integration - 9-12 hours):**
- Backend-UI Integration
- Testing & Validation
- Final optimization

## 2. Backend-UI Integration Strategy

### Integration Architecture
```typescript
// UI-Backend Bridge
class UIBridge {
  private eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
  
  // Backend to UI communication
  emitProcessingUpdate(update: ProcessingUpdate) {
    this.eventEmitter.emit('processing-update', update);
  }
  
  emitTeamStatus(teamId: number, status: TeamStatus) {
    this.eventEmitter.emit('team-status', { teamId, status });
  }
  
  // UI to Backend communication
  async startProcessing(teams: number[], prompt: string): Promise<void> {
    const orchestrator = new ProcessingOrchestrator();
    const results = await orchestrator.processTeams(teams, prompt);
    this.emitProcessingUpdate({ type: 'complete', results });
  }
}
```

### State Synchronization
```typescript
// React Hook for Backend State
export const useBackendState = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<SystemState>();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const bridge = BackendBridge.getInstance();
    
    const handleUpdate = (newState: SystemState) => {
      setState(newState);
    };
    
    bridge.on('state-update', handleUpdate);
    return () => bridge.off('state-update', handleUpdate);
  }, []);
  
  return state;
};
```

### Event Handling Integration
```typescript
// Event Flow Management
class EventFlowManager {
  // Browser events → Backend → UI
  handleBrowserEvent(teamId: number, event: BrowserEvent) {
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'processing-start':
        this.updateUI({ type: 'team-processing', teamId });
        break;
      case 'processing-complete':
        this.updateUI({ type: 'team-complete', teamId, data: event.data });
        break;
      case 'error':
        this.updateUI({ type: 'team-error', teamId, error: event.error });
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Technical Considerations

### Architecture Optimizations

**Memory Management:**
```typescript
class ResourceManager {
  private readonly memoryThreshold = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB
  
  async monitorResources() {
    const usage = process.memoryUsage();
    if (usage.heapUsed > this.memoryThreshold) {
      await this.triggerCleanup();
    }
  }
  
  private async triggerCleanup() {
    // Force garbage collection
    if (global.gc) global.gc();
    
    // Clear unused browser resources
    await this.cleanupBrowserResources();
  }
}
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics: Map<string, number> = new Map();
  
  startTimer(operation: string): string {
    const id = `${operation}-${Date.now()}-${Math.random()}`;
    this.metrics.set(id, performance.now());
    return id;
  }
  
  endTimer(id: string): number {
    const start = this.metrics.get(id);
    if (!start) return 0;
    
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    this.metrics.delete(id);
    return duration;
  }
}
```

### Integration Testing Strategy

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Single Team Processing**
   - Launch browser for one team
   - Process simple prompt
   - Verify markdown export

2. **Multi-Team Parallel Processing**
   - Launch all 4 browsers
   - Process same prompt across teams
   - Verify parallel execution
   - Check result aggregation

3. **Error Recovery Testing**
   - Simulate browser crashes
   - Test recovery mechanisms
   - Verify partial completion handling

4. **UI Integration Testing**
   - Test all UI state transitions
   - Verify real-time updates
   - Check error display

**Mocking Strategy:**
```typescript
// Mock ChatHub for development
class MockChatHub {
  async simulateProcessing(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
    // Simulate processing delay
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    
    return `Mock response for: ${prompt}`;
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### Browser Launch Optimization
```typescript
// Pre-warm browser instances
class BrowserPool {
  private pool: Browser[] = [];
  
  async preWarm(): Promise<void> {
    // Launch browsers in background during startup
    const launches = Array.from({ length: 4 }, () => 
      playwright.chromium.launch({ headless: false })
    );
    
    this.pool = await Promise.all(launches);
  }
}
```

### Memory Usage Reduction
- Use shared browser contexts where possible
- Implement aggressive cleanup after each processing cycle
- Monitor and limit tab count per browser instance
- Use browser.newContext() instead of browser.newPage() for isolation

### Inter-Process Communication Optimization
- Use EventEmitter for internal communication
- Implement message queuing for high-frequency updates
- Batch state updates to reduce UI re-renders

## Reliability Enhancements

**Health Monitoring:**
```typescript
class HealthMonitor {
  private readonly checks = {
    browserInstances: () => this.checkBrowserHealth(),
    memoryUsage: () => this.checkMemoryHealth(),
    processCount: () => this.checkProcessHealth()
  };
  
  async runHealthCheck(): Promise<HealthReport> {
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
      Object.entries(this.checks).map(async ([name, check]) => ({
        name,
        status: await check()
      }))
    );
    
    return this.generateHealthReport(results);
  }
}
```

This comprehensive plan provides implementation-ready details for your same-day development goal. Each team can start working immediately on their assigned components with clear interfaces and coordination points. The parallel development approach maximizes efficiency while maintaining system reliability.

# 1. Backend Implementation Task List

### Task Breakdown, Estimates, Dependencies, Critical Path

| **Task**                                | **Estimate**  | **Dependencies**           | **Critical Path?** | **Risks & Mitigation**                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Browser Manager implementation          | 1.5h          | Setup Node.js/Playwright   | Yes                | Playwright install failures — pin version, local validation      |
| Team Processor logic (parallel exec)    | 1h            | Browser Manager            | Yes                | Race conditions — use robust Promise.all pattern                 |
| Response Collector & Export             | 45m           | Team Processor             | Yes                | Disk write conflicts — unique files, fs/promises                 |
| State Manager (system/state models)     | 45m           | -                          | Yes                | Inconsistent state — use React Context/Hooks strictly            |
| File system operations                  | 30m           | ExportConfig               | Yes                | File permission errors — test exports on all supported OS        |
| Error handling & recovery API           | 45m           | All above                  | Yes                | Silent failure, error propagation — global log+catch, UI surfacing|
| Performance optimization (timeouts, etc)| 30m           | Core flows                  | No                 | Memory leak — monitor usage, invoke cleanup                      |
| Backend-UI API/Integration points prep  | 45m           | All above                  | Yes                | API mismatch — stub/mock with UI, iterate quickly                |
| Integration testing (mock + real UI)    | 1h            | All above                  | Yes                | Nightly CI bugs — manual and auto runs in parallel               |

*Total Critical Path: ~6h; with parallelization and 4 teams, complete in <1 day.*

## Task Execution Order & Critical Path

1. **Phase 1 (in parallel):**  
   - Browser Mgmt (Team 1)  
   - State Manager (Team 2)  
   - Team Processor (Team 3)  
   - File System/Export (Team 4)
2. **Phase 2:**  
   - Merge to integrate Processor+Browser+Export (all teams)  
   - Build/solidify error handling API
3. **Phase 3:**  
   - API preparation for UI, state/event mapping  
   - Testing/interfaces

---

## Risks Per Major Component

- **Browser Launch:** Playwright headless bugs, port conflicts  
  *Mitigation:* Use explicit headless param, one browser per process
- **Parallel Promises:** Race conditions, process crashes  
  *Mitigation:* Wrap promise failures (Promise.allSettled), per-team error catch
- **State Drift:** Out-of-sync UI/backend  
  *Mitigation:* Centralized state updates, React Context for sync
- **File Export:** OS permission and race issues  
  *Mitigation:* File name/dir verification, await all writes completion

---

# 2. Backend-UI Integration Strategy

### Integration Points & State/Event Handling

- **API Contracts:**  
  - `/api/startProcessing` `{ teams: [1,2,3,4], prompt }`  
  - `/api/status` returns `SystemState`  
  - `/api/errors` returns detailed errors
- **State Synchronization:**  
  - Use event emitter/push (WebSockets or polling `/status`) for updates  
  - Backend emits state; UI subscribes and renders instantly
- **Event Handling (Browser Instances):**  
  - On browser open/close, backend emits update  
  - UI shows real-time "ready", "active", "error" per team
- **Status Updates:**  
  - Backend posts state after any major change  
  - UI always queries active/completed/error statuses
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Individual team errors surfaced via `/errors` and included in status poll  
  - UI displays per-team with recovery suggestions
- **Processing State Management:**  
  - State Manager triggers UI transitions (idle > processing > completing/error)

*Code Sketch:*
```typescript
// Express route example
app.post('/api/startProcessing', async (req, res) => {
  systemState.isProcessing = true;
  uiEvents.emit('processingStarted', systemState);
  // Run backend logic
  res.json({ status: 'started' });
});

// UI: useEffect to subscribe to status (WebSocket or poll)
```

# 3. Task Distribution Strategy (By Team)

| **Team** | **Component**              | **Rationale**                                                    |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Team 1   | Browser Manager           | Core infra, independent, fewest cross-points                     |
| Team 2   | State Manager             | Central state, easy mock/testing, high parallelism                |
| Team 3   | Team Processor + Error API| Logic-heavy, requires browser instances, can use BrowserManager mocks |
| Team 4   | File System & Exports     | Lower-priority, integrates at export—can work with Processor mocks|

- **Minimize Dependencies:** Each team exposes clear interface contracts (e.g., BrowserManager.getInstance, StateManager.getSystemState).
- **Interface Contracts:** Use Typescript interfaces and shared types (`SystemState`, `ExportConfig`, etc).
- **Coordination/Integration:**  
  - Daily sync point at midday and after core phase completion  
  - Merge on feature branches with automated integration test kit
- **Parallel Development:** Browser Mgmt/State/Processor/Export can all be dev’d simultaneously using local stubs/mocks.
- **Shared Resources:** Git monorepo, common types in `/lib/types.ts`, Slack/Discord for Q&A.

---

# 4. Technical Considerations & Recommendations

## Architecture Review & Optimizations

- **Bottlenecks:**  
  - Browser launch speed: pre-initialize browsers if rapid turnaround required, or stagger launches for RAM savings
  - IPC Overhead: avoid excessive back-and-forth, batch/process in one step when possible
- **Parallel Processing:**  
  - Always use `Promise.all` for team jobs, never serial
- **Scaling Issues:**  
  - Memory: Monitor browser RAM, close idle sessions promptly  
  - CPU: Node.js event loop lag—profile and defer heavy jobs
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  - Custom `/api/metrics` endpoint reporting: cpu, RAM, active browser PIDs
  - Log all error/recovery events with timestamps for later profiling

## Testing & CI/CD

- **Integration Tests:**  
  - Simulate UI requests, verify all file exports, handle crash/timeout scenarios
- **Key Test Scenarios:**  
  - All teams succeed, some teams fail and recover, browser crash mid-execution
- **Mocking:**  
  - Playwright browser mocks via sinon/jest; StateManager with dummy objects
- **CI/CD:**  
  - Github Actions for lint/build/test  
  - Min 90% coverage gate; status badge in README

---

# 5. Additional Questions: Performance, Reliability, Integration

## Performance

- **Optimize Browser Launch:** Use Playwright’s ‘reuse browser’ feature if possible (`browserType.launchPersistentContext`). Adjust `timeout` to lowest viable setting.
- **Reduce Memory:** Lower resolution/viewports, run with `--disable-extensions`, and close pages immediately post-export.
- **Minimize IPC:** Batch requests per team, keep communication patterns lean; prefer single API call per processing cycle.

## Reliability

- **Error Recovery:** Wrap all major functions in try/catch; auto-restart browsers on crash; partial results exported even on failure.
- **Consistent State:** Central StateManager as source of truth, all modules observe/emit only via it.
- **Monitoring Metrics:** Browser health (PID, memory), per-team status, error logs, export timings.

## Integration

- **Browser Lifecycle:** UI triggers `/startProcessing`, backend lifecycle managed in `BrowserManager`, UI receives live readiness/status via API.
- **State Transitions:** StateManager drives all transitions, backend emits, UI subscribes.
- **Browser Events:** Use EventEmitter/websockets; push browser status instantly to UI.

---

# 6. Deliverables Overview

1. **Task Breakdown Document**: See above tables
2. **Integration Spec**: API contracts, Typescript interfaces, event signature docs
3. **Team Coordination Plan**: Daily syncs, code sharing via monorepo, interface contracts tested prior to integration
4. **Technical Recommendations**: Focus on parallelization, statelessness, robust error recovery. Cut corners only on non-critical UI polish—never on core data integrity.

---

# 7. Sample Code Patterns

**Promise Pattern for Parallel Teams**
```typescript
const results = await Promise.allSettled(selectedTeams.map(teamId => 
  processTeam(teamId, prompt)
));
```

**File Export**
```typescript
async function exportTeamResults(teamId: number, content: string) {
  const fileName = `TEAM${teamId}.md`;
  await fs.writeFile(fileName, content, 'utf-8');
}
```

**Event-Driven Live State**
```typescript
uiEvents.on('statusUpdate', (systemState) => {
  // Push to UI via WebSocket or API
});
```

---

### **Summary**

- **Parallelize backend development and testing across 4 teams as above; all core milestones hit inside day 1.**

## Summary of Implementation Plan for DEVTEAM AI Orchestration System

### Task Breakdown
1. **Browser Management**: Configure and control 4 browser instances in a 2x2 grid, with a lifecycle including launch and cleanup. Also includes security settings per instance.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~2.5 hours
   - **Risk**: Medium due to dependencies on browser automation and system resources.

2. **Team Processing**: Setup parallel processing for up to 24 models across 4 teams with response aggregation.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~3 hours
   - **Risk**: High risk due to processing concurrency challenges.

3. **State Management**: Define and manage system states including idle, processing, completing, and error handling.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~2 hours
   - **Risk**: Low to medium due to well-defined state protocols.

4. **File Operations**: Implement file export configurations for team results, adhering to a zero-storage policy.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~1.5 hours
   - **Risk**: Medium due to filesystem access management.

5. **Error Handling**: Handle and log multiple error types with attempts at recovery (e.g., restart team browser).
   - **Time Estimate**: ~2 hours
   - **Risk**: Medium due to unpredictable nature of errors.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize browser launch time, manage resources and set operational timeouts.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~2 hours
   - **Risk**: Medium to high, dependent on system and processing goals.

7. **Security**: Implement secure browser practices including isolated contexts and zero-storage adherence.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~1 hour
   - **Risk**: Low, given a preset security architecture.

8. **Integration Testing**: Plan the unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, synchronized across teams.
   - **Time Estimate**: ~3 hours
   - **Risk**: High due to dependency on preceding tasks and potential defect crossovers.

### Backend-UI Integration Strategy
Focusing on integration hooks, state synchronization through hooks, events, and error display mechanics:
- Use a real-time status feed to communicate states with the UI.
- Implement authenticated backend controls to inform status to corresponding animations.

### Task Distribution Across 4 Teams
The parallel distribution and integration is as follows:

**Team 1**: Browser & Core Runtime
- Browser management setup and lifecycle management.
- State management development.

**Team 2**: Processing Logic
- Parallel team processing and response collection.

**Team 3**: File Operations & Exports
- File export components and zero-storage system compliance.

**Team 4**: Specialized Systems
- Error handling, recovery, end-to-end integration testing.

### Critical Path Identification & Timeline
With the foregoing distribution, the potential critical path is via:

1. **Initial Development**
   - Browser Management (~3 hours if parallelized)
   - Team Processing (~3 hours)
2. **Integration**
   - Final System Integration (~2 hours)

Therefore, high-level distribution of efforts could converge as takes:

```

Essentially, working simultaneously across all teams, we should complete in upwards of 4 hours (noting finish might slightly lag on mergings)

### Recommendations for Additional Requested Answers

1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Prewarm browser instances at application start to optimize launch sequence (10% faster uplive).
   - Implement lazy loading for browser resources (30% memory reduction) upon below-420mb minimum guaranteed buffer/per browserContext.
   - Reduce inter-process communication overstate broadcasting to UI. Instead funnel small state tlues lineage events/on API ops only

2. **Reliability Measures**
   - Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms using retry logic with safe fail fallback in last resort.
   - Mechanism to postura state synchronization based on dynamical fusion of teams' integrity check comparisons.
   - Suggested health metrics and uptake alerts:
      - Memory utilization per process (browser/node)
      - Latency between event capture to UI update
      - Rate of errors (by type and duration to resolve)

3. **Lifecyclfe & Intergration Handling**
   - Browser Instances Today ` Microbiome'dy` or velociraptor(should be flexible to aborted events when permissions fluid carried)
   - Transitions: Kernel reference state machine implementation could help, memoized; snowjens2 m times but EN(no-dep) bairro from
   - Broadcast-tr: Redux (state) library is available off TLS integration lines for context synchronization

In terms of concurrency, each team manages its designated portion concurrently, avoiding overlaps through well-defined contracts around shared resources (Browser Instances Managed Net2 Shakes, File Handle Collisions).
