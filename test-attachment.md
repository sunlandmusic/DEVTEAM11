# Test Attachment File

This is a test file to verify that the multi-task attachment functionality is working correctly.

## Test Content

The models should be able to read this content when the file is attached in multi-task mode.

### Key Points to Test:

1. File content should be accessible to models
2. Models should be able to process the content
3. No "cannot access file" errors should occur

## Expected Behavior

When this file is uploaded in multi-task mode, the AI models should:
- Acknowledge they can see the file content
- Process the content appropriately
- Provide responses based on the file content

If the fix is working correctly, you should see responses that reference this specific content rather than saying they cannot access the file.
